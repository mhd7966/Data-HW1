Question 3 : 
In the first step, with SparkConf() set default config to configs
then we create a spark context with that configs
 
, in next step read text file with spark context and return lines after that split lines with flatMap and now we have words,
in next level per word watch index 0 with filter and after that map set value, and the end sum of values in map with same key give result.
